The Vancouver, BC based team provided a very professional looking ring box, a bookmark and a personalized thank you card, which made the buying experience that much better. \n\nWould recommend this Etsy shop to anyone.",

I found this shop on tik tok and love their size inclusivity. The ring is really well made and the seam is hardly noticeable. I imagine it will be very durable and last me forever. Thanks!",

I was worried since it was a thin ring it wouldn’t look exactly how I pictured but I was wrong. I 10/10 recommend. I had a Pandora ring, size 8, I wanted to wear as a thumb ring but it was a bit too loose. Being able to order a 7 3/4 was perfect! The ring isn’t too tight but also doesn’t slide around. I’m so happy I ordered this, it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for!",
