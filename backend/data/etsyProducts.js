          "I like it! But It’s a bit smaller than 8.5 (the size I ordered ) it’s just snug which I don’t mind! Quality is amazing probably one of the best natural gold filled colourive seen on the market. It looks very similar to gold plated in my opinion. it does seem very light though-weight wise, so if you drop it you might not hear it lol. But..Overall hasn’t tarnished and is still in shape!! :)  I definitely would recommend and I’ll be buying from lumin again :)",

The Vancouver, BC based team provided a very professional looking ring box, a bookmark and a personalized thank you card, which made the buying experience that much better. \n\nWould recommend this Etsy shop to anyone.",

The fit is also perfect.\n\nShipping was really fast, packaging was beautiful and I also appreciated the compostable mailer. Seller’s communication was very good. Overall a great purchase. 10/10 would recommend this product and seller!",

          "I love it, its so shiny and pretty. One suggestion is to make circle link that the clasp connects to slightly smaller because I was unable to insert my pendant onto the necklace. I opened the circle myself with pliers and then put my pendant through. I can imagine other people having this problem too. But otherwise its great quality :)",
