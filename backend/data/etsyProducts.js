It does get a bit twisted up, but I don't think there is a way to avoid that when you have two necklaces connected. I got the 14/15 size and that seems just right for me! There is an extender in the back, but you can only put it to the shortest or longest length. In all honesty, that's how I use extenders anyways. I do frequently wear it on either end of the lengths depending on the neckline of the top I'm wearing.",
